Cryptocurrency has changed the way we use currency. It allows us to be
in a sense or own bankers and it provides us with new ways to buy and
sell products. However, it brings with it one of the inherent problems
that all other currencies have weather its paper money or digital
currency. Malicious users and thieves will go to just about
any lengths necessary in order to obtain your hard earned digital currency.                                        They don't care about who you are, how nice a person 
or how adversely affected you will be from them stealing from you.

It seams like everyday we hear a story about someone either losing
their digital currency or having had it stolen by a
malicious user. In many of those cases had the victim
implemented a few simple security measures their digital currency would
not have been stolen. This does not mean that you can follow all the
security practices on the page and you will have nothing to worry about.
Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done to prevent a gifted
attacker that is committed to gaining entry into your
computer. The best you can do is use the security best practices below
in an effort to mitigate a majority of these threats.

## Security Best Practices

### Physical Security

The first thing that we will go over is physical security. This means
restricting physical access to your computer and hardware wallets. How
do we do this? It starts with following the dos and don'ts.

* If you are leaving your house it is a good idea to put your laptop and
  hardware wallet in a safe. Not all of use have a safe in our homes,
  however they are worth the money if we have something of value.
  Otherwise, if no safe is available, hiding your hardware in a place
  that is hard to find is another option even if its a linen closet
  or under a blanket in your bedroom. Remember a thief who steals your
  laptop may not even know that there is software wallet on your
  computer filled with currency. The thief just sees a valuable laptop for
  the taking. The same thing goes for hardware wallets. The thief may
  not even know what a hardware wallet is, all he cares about is that it
  could have value.

* Never leave your laptop or hardware wallet in a public place. If you
  do take them into a library or classrooms, do not leave them alone,
  not even for a minute while you go to the restroom or out to your car.
  Thieves look for such opportunities. However, if you must leave your
  laptop unattended in a public place, lock it up with a Kensington
  lock.

* Never leave your laptop or hardware wallet unattended in your office
  or dorm room. Once again if you must step out for a moment, use a
  Kensington lock. Remember thieves will go after what is easiest for
  them to steal. If they have a choice between 2 identical laptops and 1
  of them is secured with a Kensington lock, which one do you think they
  will go for? They will take the path of least resistance and steal the
  laptop that does not have a notebook lock.

* If you have to leave your laptop or hardware wallet in a car, put them
  in a bag and put the bag in the trunk. It is preferable that you stop
  somewhere before you reach your destination so potential thieves don't
  see you putting your hardware into the trunk. ##

### Choosing an Os

Choosing an operating system is arguably the single most important
decision that you will make when it comes to keeping your digital currency 
safe and secure. With so many operating systems to choose from how do we 
decide which one best suits our needs? First we will have do decide what our
needs our. Since this paper focuses on keeping our digital currency
secure will require a open-source OS. Why do we need an open-source
operating system and not say, that wonderful OS named Window? Well, that
is one of the questions we are going to answer along with a few others
on our journey to find the right OS.

- **Open-source v.s. Proprietary**


Open-source, we all have heard those words before, but what do they mean? 
Simply stated open-source is a decentralized (just like aeternity) 
developmental model that encourages open collaboration between peers and 
making products such as source code and documentation freely available to 
the public. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where
programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within
the community. Code is released under the terms of a software license. 
Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and 
publish their version (fork) back to the community.



Now that you have a basic understanding of open-source lets move onto                                           proprietary (also referred to as closed-source) software. Relatively
speaking proprietary software is the opposite of open-source software.
Proprietary software is computer software for which the software's 
publisher or another person retains intellectual property rights--usually
copyright of the source code. What this means is the public can not
download, modify, or publish their version of the software with out the
express permission of the software's publisher.


In most cases the publisher will not let anyone see the source code out
of fear that trade secrets or the source code will be stolen. You may be
wondering what all this has to do with keeping our digital currency
safe. Well, we are about to get to that now that we know the difference
between open-source and proprietary software.

- **Proprietary**

Proprietary operating systems like Windows has many more users than Mac and Linux combined. Since
they have all of these user does it mean that is is more secure? Why else would so many people use
them?

The answer to the first question is NO!Windows has more users but those people are not using Windows because it
is a secure operating system.

 
To answer the second question. Most people
are using it because because it has all the bells and whistles and its
easy to use. What makes Windows OS insecure is that the source code is
closed-source.

Microsoft if very strict about who they let see the source code. When
they do show the source code its only to their clients (like the
government) but only after signing a Non-Disclosure agreement. This way
if someone were to steal trade secrets or tell the public what they saw
there would be severe legal repercussions.

What this means is that no independent security audits can be performed
and published on Windows OS. There is no way for the public to know if
there are any major security holes in the OS. We just have to take
Microsoft at it word that there are no back doors (insert laughter) or
security vulnerabilities (laughing even harder).

- **Open-source**

Open-source operating systems like Linux do not have nearly as many
user as Window but they are much more secure. The source code is freely
available for everyone to see. This means that independent security
audits can be performed to make sure there are no major vulnerabilities
present. This also means that there are many more eyes looking at the
source code and therefore reporting security issues to the developers
much quickly than if it was closed-source. Many times bugs are reported
and patched before the security vulnerability can be exploited.

If there is a backdoor to the OS it would be found and reported very
quickly. This is all because Linux is open-source. ### Now that we have
a good understanding of proprietary and open-source we can discuss other
reasons why an open-source Linux disro is more secure than a
closed-source Windows OS.
***

* **User Account Privileges** In Windows, users are generally given
  administrator privileges by default which means they have access to
  everything on the system. If the virus is able to penetrate their
  system, they can quickly gain access to important parts of the system.
  On the other hand, in Linux, users are given lower level access
  rights, and, theoretically, the virus can only access the users local
  files and folders thus preventing malicious code from infecting the
  entire system.
***
* **Social Engineering** Closed-source operating systems like Windows
  are more vulnerabilities to social engineering attacks. Most viruses
  are spread by convincing users to doing something they shouldn't, like
  opening up an email attachment that is carrying a virus or worm or
  clicking on a malicious link.

  What makes Linux less susceptible to these types of attacks is most Linux
  users don't have root access however, it's much harder to accomplish any
  real damage on a Linux system by getting them to do something foolish.
  Before any real damage could be done, a Linux user would have to read
  the email, save the attachment, give it executable permissions and then
  run the program. Not very likely, in other words.

***

* **Separateness of Environment** Linux works in many environments and
  distros such as Debian, Qubes,  Arch, and many others. With
  Various email clients, shells and packaging systems that makes the
  system extremely fragmented and difficult for any virus. So, whereas a
  virus can be targeted squarely at Windows users, since for the most
  part use the same technology, reaching more than a small faction of
  Linux users is much more difficult.

***

* **How many eyes see the code** As stated above Windows source code is
  closed-source and has a limited set of paid developers who try to find
  the problems in the code. Windows devs would have you believe this is
  a good thing. They want you to believe that its a good thing that only
  the paid devs can see the source code. The phrase they like to use is
  "security through obscurity", which is a very common term and I'm sure
  you have heard of it. The expression is intended to suggest that
  proprietary software is more secure by virtue of its closed nature. If
  hackers can't see the code, then it's harder for them to create
  exploits for it: or so the thinking goes. Unfortunately for Windows
  users, that's just not true. Linux on the on the hand has a larger
  group of developers and testers working on a set of code, this makes
  it much more likely any flaws will be caught and fixed quickly. This,
  in other words, is essentially the polar opposite of the "security
  through obscurity" argument. Not only that, but Linux users can fix
  problems themselves. Microsoft may tout its large team of paid
  developers, but it's unlikely that team can compare with a global base
  of Linux user-developers around the globe.
### Choosing Your Linux Distribution 
With so many Linux distros: also referred to as flavors of Linux, how do we decide which one to use. Many people will tell you they are all the same and it comes down to user preference. However, all though many may share the same Linux kernel, there are some major differences in the distributions. Since we are focusing on keeping our digital currency safe and secure we want a distro that focuses on security and stability.

**[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)** is well known for its security and stability and sets itself apart by being the largest and most comprehensive Linux distribution ever created having well over 1,000 volunteers working on the project since 1993. Because of this many derivatives of Linux distros are based off of Debian, and it has become the grandfather of a large family of Linux distributions.

Advantages 
* Efficient and well integrated packaging for a more robust system.
* Full disk encryption
* iptables - a user-space application program that allows users to configure the tables provided by the Linux 
             kernel firewall (implemented as different Netfilter modules) and the chains and rules it stores.
* SELinux - Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies.
* Publicly available bug tracking system.
* Stability - some users report running Debian 1+ year without a single reboot!
* Security - being 100% open, security issues are exposed and plugged quickly. 
***
**[Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/)** is a security-focused desktop operating system that aims to provide security through isolation. In order to secure a desktop, a Qubes user should take care of isolating various environments, so that if one of the components gets compromised, the malicious software would get access to only the data inside that environment. With Qubes The assumption is that there can be no perfect, bug-free desktop environment. Such an environment counts millions of lines of code, billions of software/hardware interactions. To provide isolation, Qubes leverages virtualization through the Xen hypervisor to provide isolation between two different qubes. User environments can be based on Fedora, Debian, Whonix, and Windows, among other operating systems.

Advantages

* The Xen hypervisor and administrative domain (dom0) in Qubes OS actively discourages any activity other than running VMs.
* The network stack and Wi-Fi drivers are running in a dedicated, unprivileged network VM (NetVM), which substantially reduces the attack surface.
* An additional firewall VM is used to house the Linux kernel-based firewall, providing extra protection against a  compromised NetVM.
* By default, Qubes OS is firewalled and no incoming ports are open.
* No networking is present in the administrative domain (dom0). Even dom0 upgrades are done in a dedicated UpdateVM.
  (currently set by default to NetVM), before those are verified and installed in dom0.
* DisposableVMs are available to open untrusted applications, links, attachments and documents.
* Greater security of email-centric work environments is possible by using split GPG to protect private keys and      
  limiting network connections exclusively to the chosen email server.
* Protection against unintentional leaks of critical user data is possible by setting an empty NetVM field for the 
  corresponding qube.
***
**[Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Main_Page)**  is a desktop operating system designed for advanced security and privacy. Whonix mitigates the threat of common attack vectors while maintaining usability. Online anonymity is realized via fail-safe, automatic, and desktop-wide use of the Tor network. A heavily reconfigured Debian base is run inside multiple virtual machines, providing a substantial layer of protection from malware and IP address leaks. Commonly used applications are pre-installed and safely pre-configured for immediate use. The user is not jeopardized by installing additional applications or personalizing the desktop. Whonix is under active development and is the only operating system designed to be run inside a virtual machine and paired with Tor.

Advantages

* Based on Debian, which is well known for its security and stability.
* Only connections through the Tor network are permitted 
* Servers can be run, and applications used anonymously over the internet.
* DNS leaks are impossible
* Malware with root privileges cannot discover the user's real IP address.
* Threats posed by misbehaving applications and user error are minimized.

**[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)** (which stands for ‘The Amnesiac Incognito Live System’) is probably the most well known privacy-focused distro however its features also make it a very secure OS . It can be run from a DVD in Live mode whereby it loads entirely into your system RAM and will leave no trace of its activity. The OS can also be used in ‘persistent’ mode where your settings can be stored on an encrypted USB stick. All connections are routed through the anonymity network Tor, which conceals your location. The applications in Tails have also been carefully selected to enhance your privacy and security.

Advantages

* Tails is amnesiac which means that when you reboot the OS any changes that were made to it in that session are    
  erased. So if a malicious user was to infect your computer with a virus or worm it would no longer be there after 
  you reboot the system. Keep in mind that if you are infected with a virus during that a session all the work you
  did during that session could be compromised. If you entered your password into your web wallet the malicious user 
  could very well have your password.
* The Tails devs have already tested and configured much of the software for you.  Most of the applications you
  will need come pre-installed.
* Uses state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging. .

### BIOS Passwords
Let’s say you’ve followed good security practices and have a password set on your Linux user account. When your computer boots, someone will have to enter your Linux user account password to use it or access your files, right? Not necessarily.

The person could insert a removable device like a USB drive, CD, or DVD with a live operating system on it. They could boot from that device and access a live Linux desktop if your files are unencrypted, they could access your files. A  user account password doesn’t protect your files. 

You could change the boot order to force the computer to always boot from its internal hard drive, but someone could enter your BIOS and change your boot order to boot the removable device.

A BIOS  password provides some protection against this. Depending on how you configure the password, people will need the password to boot the computer or just to change BIOS settings.

Of course, if someone has physical access to your computer, all bets are off. They could crack it open and remove your hard drive or insert a different hard drive. They could use their physical access to reset the BIOS password. A BIOS password still does provide extra protection here, particularly in situations where people have access to a keyboard and USB ports, but the computer’s case is locked up and they can’t open it.

These passwords are set in your BIOS settings screen. You’ll need to reboot your computer and press the appropriate key during the boot-up process to bring up the BIOS settings screen. This key varies from computer to computer, but is often F2. If you need help, look at your computer’s documentation.

In the BIOS settings screen, locate the password option, configure your password settings however you like, and enter a password. You may be able to set different passwords for example, one password that allows the computer to boot and one that controls access to BIOS settings.

You’ll also want to visit the Boot Order section and ensure the boot order is locked down so people can’t boot from removable devices without your permission.

### Full Disk Encryption
Disk encryption is a technology which protects the information on your hard drive, USB, or CD by converting it into unreadable code that cannot be deciphered easily by unauthorized people. Disk encryption used encryption software of hardware to encrypt all of the data that goes on a disk or disk volume Disk encryption prevents unauthorized access to the data stored on the disk.

What we will be focusing on is referred to as Full Disk Encryption. You would think--from the name--that full disk encryption signifies that everything on the disk is encrypted: however the master boot record (MBR) or the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) which is the code that starts the OS loading sequence, is not encrypted. There are drives with hardware based encryption that also encrypt the MBR or UEFI partitions. These are proprietary and therefore the source code can not be audited by independent security professionals. For this reason we will not be discussing hardware encrypted drives.  

Since Linux is our OS of choice  , we will be using LUKS: or Linux Unified Key setup. LUKS is based on an enhanced version of cryptsetup, using dm-crypt as the disk encryption backend. The next question is how do we encrypt our OS. With most Linux distros you are given the option to encrypt your system during installation.  All you have to do is follow  the documentation for your given disrto and in most cases the OS installer will guide you through the installation. The most that is required of you is to put in the required information when prompted.  After you have completed the installation you should have a Linux Os with full disk encryption

There is one very important thing you must know however. As mentioned previously with full disk encryption the boot partition, or MBR is not encrypted. This means that if a malicious user was to have physical access to your computer, malicious code--like a keylogger-- could be installed on you boot partition.  It only takes a few seconds for a USB to be inserted into your laptop and a virus uploaded. It does not matter if your computer is running or powered down, It is still just as vulnerable. You are given some protection is you have a bios password and you have configured your computer not to auto-mount external media. I say "some protection" because there is no practical way to stop a gifted attacker if they are committed to compromising your computer. The only other way to prevent an attacker from doing this is to transfer you boot partition to an external USB. This way if you remove the USB from you computer no one will be able to boot it unless they use a live CD. I hope you are starting to see a pattern hear and I'm going to say it again: **There is no way to stop a gifted attacker if they are committed to compromising your computer!!**

### Passwords
We all use them, weather its signing in to our email accounts,signing into Github, or unlocking our OS user account. Passwords are in our lives and they are here to stay, but many don't take the time to think about what goes into making a strong high password. Most people use a password that is easy for them to remember like a pets name, a birthday, or the name of one of their children. These are the passwords malicious users want us to have. All a cracker has to do is search on Google to find out all the personal information they need to know about someone to gain access to their computer. So how do we prevent someone from figuring out our password? Keep on reading and by the time we are done you will know that and much more.

We are going to start of with some guidelines for making a strong password.
* Use a minimum password length of 12 to 14 characters if permitted.
* Include lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters, numbers and symbols if permitted.
* Generate passwords randomly where feasible.
* Avoid using the same password twice (e.g., across multiple user accounts and/or software systems).
* Avoid character repetition, keyboard patterns, dictionary words, letter or number sequences, usernames, relatives
  or pet names, romantic links (current or past) and biographical information (e.g., ID numbers, ancestors' names or
  dates).
* Avoid using information that is or might become publicly associated with the you or the account.
* Avoid using information that your colleagues and/or acquaintances might know to be associated with the you.
* Avoid using a place of birth or names of educational facilities like a high school or university.
* Avoid using something related to a favorite sports team.
* Do not use the word "password"!  Yes people use it all the time.
* Do not use passwords which consist wholly of any simple combination of the aforementioned weak components.
* Do not use the default password that came with your device or user account.
* **Do not write your password down on a piece of paper or sticky note!** If you do why bother making a strong 
  password?

Now that we have some guidelines we can start working on our password. As mentioned above password length is very important but we also want a password with uppercase and lowercase letters, and it should have numbers and special characters such as [ &*?@#: ].  We also want our passwords to be as random as possible.  Random passwords consist of a string of symbols of specified length taken from some set of symbols using a random selection process in which each symbol is equally likely to be selected. The symbols can be individual characters from a character set (e.g., the ASCII character set), syllables designed to form pronounceable passwords, or even words from a word list (thus forming a passphrase). Many users choose a password that is memorable, however the easier a password is for the user to remember generally means it will be easier for an attacker to guess. On the other hand passwords which are difficult to remember may also reduce the security of the system because (a)  users may need to write down their password on a sticky note, which in turn will end up affixed to their desktop  or computer monitor. (b) users are more likely to re-use the same password for all of their accounts.    

One of the better ways to create a strong password is to use memory techniques.  With mnemonic passwords users develop memorable phrases and use them to generate more or less random passwords which are nevertheless relatively easy for the user to remember. For instance, the first letter of each word in a memorable phrase. In the example we will use a memorable phrase and use the first letter in each word as part of our password.
    
     Example:  four red balls rolled down the hill and stopped at Jose's house    password: frbrdthasaJh

This password is easy to remember but it does not have numbers or special characters. Another way to make mnemonic passwords is called after-the-fact mnemonics: After the password has been established, invent a mnemonic phrase that fits. It does not have to be reasonable or sensible, only memorable. This allows passwords to be random. So If you created the password [ 7paHjolT? ] a possible mnemonic would be 'seven people and Horses jump over lost Trees? ' .  

Another way to create strong passwords is to combine mnemonic with phonetic pronunciation. Phonetic pronunciation is means how something sounds. Instead of writing what you see [e.g , at , and , four ] we are going to type how it sounds (e.g [ate = 8] [at = @] [and = & ] [four = 4) . Obviously we can't do this for every word but it is useful for some phrases . In the next example we will use the phrase from earlier.

     Example:  four red balls rolled down the hill and stopped at Jose's house  password: 4rbrdth&s@Jh

  As you can see the password now has upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters. Although it is a little bit shorter than what is recommended it is still a fairly strong password and easy to remember. There are however other ways we can make our passwords stronger.

We have gone over mnemonic and phonetic password and there is another great way to make strong passwords.  This time we are we are going to combine everything we have learned and have a little fun at the same time. What we are going to do is make up a funny story.  It can be anything you want it to be and it does not have to make any sense. Actually the less sense the story makes the better.  We want to have a password with at least 12-14 characters, upper and lower case letters and numbers. In the next example  we will make a password then make up a memorable phrase to associate with the password. Remember to use phonetic pronunciation. 

     Example 1)  cH9`b8L^aydS|   camels Have nine backticks but ate Long carrots are yummy dogs smoke pipes 

   I'm sure you are thinking "How the heck could I remember that?"  You have to remember we all think differently. A password I created may be difficult for you to remember and vise versa. The way my mind associates things is unique. That story makes no sense but is easy for me to remember.  You can also use this method to create a password over the course of a week. On day one create a 4-5 character "base password ", then add 2-3 characters every day until you are satisfied with the strength of the password Keep in mind once you make a memorize a strong password you can make it stronger over time.  Every week you can add a 1 character or even 2.

### Password Managers

Another tool that can be helpful is a password manger. A password manger is a encrypted data base that assists in generating, storing, and retrieving complex passwords. The user must create a master password and/or keyfile to unlock the data base. Many of these managers also have password generators. These are simple to operate and allow users to generate strong passwords or keyfiles in seconds. One of the biggest advantages of a password manager is it eliminates the need to remember multiple password for different logins. Users are also no longer compelled to reuse the same password for multiple sites.

Generally there are 2 different types of password managers

**Locally-installed** password managers commonly reside on the user's personal computer or mobile device, such as smart phones, in the form of a locally-installed software application. These applications can be offline, wherein the password database is stored independently and locally on the same device as the password manager software. Alternatively, password managers may offer or require a cloud-based approach, wherein the password database is dependent on an online file hosting service and stored remotely, but handled by password management software installed on the user's device.

**Web-based** An online password manager is a website that securely stores login details. They are a web-based version of more conventional desktop-based password manager. The advantages of online password managers over desktop-based versions are portability (they can generally be used on any computer with a web browser and a network connection, without having to install software), and a reduced risk of losing passwords through theft from or damage to a single PC - also the same risk is present for the server that is used to store the users passwords on. In both cases this risk can be prevented by ensuring secure backups are taken.The major disadvantages of online password managers are the requirements that the user trusts the hosting site.

**Security implications**Its important to keep in mind the security of your password manager depends on the strength of the chosen master password (which might be guessed or brute-forced) and keyfile if one is used. Care must be taken that the passphrase itself is never stored locally where a malicious program or individual could read it: nor should you leave a USB with your keyfile in an unsecured location were it can be lost or stolen. A compromised master password will render all of the protected passwords vulnerable if you don not also use a keyfile. Just because you use both password and keyfile does not make a password manager infallible. As with any system which involves the user entering a password, the master password may also be attacked and discovered using a key-logger. Some password managers attempt to use virtual keyboards to reduce this risk - though this again is vulnerable to key loggers which take screenshots as data is entered. This risk can be mitigated with the use of a multi-factor verification device (keyfile) . 



 ### Man in the middle attacks
A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with one other. An example of a man-in-the-middle attack is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker.he attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within reception range of wireless access point can insert himself as a man-in-the-middle. 

As an attack that aims at circumventing mutual authentication, or lack thereof, a man-in-the-middle attack can succeed only when the attacker can impersonate each endpoint to their satisfaction as expected from the legitimate end. All protocols include some form of endpoint authentication specifically to prevent attacks. For example, authentication forwarded to either one or two parties using a mutually trusted certificate of authority.

Example:

     Suppose Bob wishes to communicate with Alice. Meanwhile, Mallory wishes to intercept the  
     conversation to eavesdrop and optionally to deliver a false message to Bob.

     First, Alice asks Bob for his public key. If Bob sends his public key to Alice, but Mallory
     is able to intercept it, a man-in-the-middle attack can begin.

     Mallory sends a forged message to Alice that purports to come from Bob, but instead includes 
     Mallory's public key.

     Alice, believing this public key is Bob's, encrypts her message with Mallory's key and
     sends the encrypted message back to Bob.
    
     Mallory again intercepts, decrypts the message using her private key, possibly alters
     it if she wants, and re-encryptes  it using the public key Bob originally sent to Alice.
     
     When Bob receives the newly encrypted message he believes it came from Alice.
