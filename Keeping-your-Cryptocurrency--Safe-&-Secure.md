DO NOT DELETE, WE NEED THIS PAGE FOR PAST OUR WORK TODAY (29th May 2017)

Cryptocurrency has changed the way we use currency.  It allows us to be in a sense or own bankers and it provides us with new ways to buy and sell products. However, it brings with it one of the inherent problems that all other currencies have weather its paper money or digital currency. (Crackers, Hackers, Thieves)<which one> will go to just about any lengths necessary in order to obtain your hard earned (aeon, digital currency). They don't care about who you are, how nice a person you are or how adversely affect you will be from them stealing your (digital currency, aeon.)

It seams like everyday we hear of a story about someone either losing their digital currency or having had it stolen by a (cracker,hacker,thief). In many of those cases had the victim implemented a few simple security measures their digital currency would not have been stolen. This does not mean that you can follow all the security practices on the page and you will have nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done to prevent a gifted  (cracker,hacker,attacker) that is committed to gain entry into your computer.  The best you can do is use the security best practices below in an effort to mitigate a majority of these threats.

# Security Best Practices

### Physcial Security

The first thing that we will go over is physical security.  This means restricting physical access to your computer and hardware wallets. How do we do this? It starts with following the do and don't. 
## 
* If you are leaving your house it is a good to put your laptop and hardware wallet in a safe.  Not all of use have a safe in our homes, however they are worth the money if we have something of value. Otherwise, if no safe is available hiding your hardware in a place that is hard to find is another option. Even if its in a linen closet or under a blanket in your bedroom. Remember a thief who steals your laptop may not even know that there is software wallet on your computer filled with aeon. The thief just sees a valuable laptop for the taking. The same thing goes for hardware wallets. The thief may not even know what a hardware wallet is, all he cares about is that it could have value. 
* Never leave your laptop or hardware wallet in a public place. If you do take them into a library or classrooms, do not leave them alone, not even for a minute while you go to the restroom or out to your car. Thieves look for such opportunities. However, if you must leave your laptop unattended in a public place, lock it up with a Kensington lock.
* Never leave your laptop or hardware wallet unattended in your office or dorm room. Once again if you must step out for a molment, use a Kensington lock. Remember thieves will go after what is easiest for them to steal.  If they have a choice between 2 identical laptops and 1 of them is secured with a Kensington lock, which one do you thing they will go for? They will take the path of least resistance and steal the laptop that does not have a notebook lock.
* If you have to leave your laptop or hardware wallet in a car, put them in a bag and put the bag  in the trunk. It is preferable that you stop somewhere before you reach your destination so potential thieves don't see you putting your hardware into the trunk.

### Choosing an Os
Choosing your operating system is arguably the single most important decision that you will make when it comes to keeping your aeon safe and secure. With so many operating systems to choose from how do we decide which one best suits our needs? First we will have do decide what our needs our. Since this paper focuses on keeping our digital currency secure will require a open-source OS.  Why do we need an open-source operating system and not say, that wonderful OS named Window?  Well, that is one of the questions we are going to answer along with a few others on our journey to find the right OS.
### 
**Open-source v.s. Proprietary**

Open-source: we all have heard those words before, but what do they mean? Simply stated open-source is a decentralized (just like aeternity) development model that encourages open collaboration between peers and making products such as source code and documentation freely available to the public. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a software license. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.  
### 
It is more than likely that you have heard of proprietary (also referred to as closed-source) software. Relatively speaking proprietary software is the opposite of open-source software. Proprietary software is computer software for which the software's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rights--usually copyright of the source code. What this means is the public can not download, modify, or publish their version of the software with out the express permission of the software's publisher. In most cases the publisher will not let anyone see the source code out of fear that trade secrets or the source code will be stolen. You may be wondering what all this has to do with keeping our digital currency safe. Well, we are about to get to that now that we know the difference between open-source and proprietary software.
### 
Proprietary operating systems like Windows have many more users than Mac and Linux combined. Since they have all of these user does it mean that is is more secure? Why else would so many people use them? The answer to the first question is NO! Windows has more users but those people are not using Windows because it is a secure operating system. To answer the second question. Most people are using it because because it has all the bells and whistles and its easy to use. What makes Windows OS insecure is that the source code is closed-source. Microsoft if very strict about who they let see the source code. When they do show the source code its only to their clients ( like the government) but only after signing a Non-Disclosure agreement. This way if someone were to steal trade secrets or tell the public what they saw there would be severe legal repercussions. What this means is that no independent security audits can be performed and published on Windows OS. There is no way for the public to know if there are any major security holes in the OS. We just have to take Microsoft at it word that there are no backdoors(insert laughter) or security vulnerabilities (laughing harder).
### 
Open-source operating systems like Linux do not have nearly as many user as Window but they are much more secure. The source code is freely available for everyone to see.  This means that independent security audits can be performed to make sure there are no major vulnerabilities present. This also means that there are many more eyes looking at the source code and therefore reporting security issues to the developers much quickly  than if it was closed-source. Many times bugs are reported and patched before the security vulnerability can be exploited. If there is a backdoor to the OS it would be found and reported very quickly. This is all because Linux is open-source. 
### 
Now that we have a good understanding of proprietary and open-source we can discuss other reasons why an open-source Linux disro is more secure than a closed-source Windows OS
 
* **User Account Privileges**
In Windows, users are generally given administrator priveleges by default which means they have access to everything  on the system. If the virus is able to penetrate their system, they can quickly gain access to important parts of the system. On the other hand, in Linux, users are given lower level access rights, and, theoretically, the virus can only access the users local files and folders thus preventing malicous code from infecting the entire system.
### 
* **Social Engineering**
Closed source operating systems like Windows are more vulnerabilities to social engineering attacks. Most viruses are spread by convincing users to doing something they shouldn't, like opening up an email attachment that is carrying a virus or worm or clicking on a malicius link.  
What makes Linux less suceptable to these types of attacks is most Linux users don't have root access however, it's much harder to accomplish any real damage on a Linux system by getting them to do something foolish. Before any real damage could be done, a Linux user would have to read the email, save the attachment, give it executable permissions and then run the program. Not very likely, in other words. 
### 
### 
* **Separateness of  Environment**
Linux works in many environments and distros such as Debian, Qubes, Openbsd, Arch, and many others. With Various email clients, shells and packaging systems that makes the system extremely fragmented and difficult for any virus. So, whereas a virus can be targeted squarely at Windows users, since for the most part use the same technology, reaching more than a small faction of Linux users is much more difficult.
###   
* **How many eyes see the code**
As stated above Windows source code is closed-source and has a limited set of paid developers who try to find the problems in the code. Windows devs would have you believe this is a good this. Like want you to beleive that ist a good thng that only the paid devs can see the source code. The phrase they like to use is "security through obscurity", which is a very common term and i'm sure you have heard of it.The expression is intended to suggest that proprietary software is more secure by virtue of its closed nature. If hackers can't see the code, then it's harder for them to create exploits for it: or so the thinking goes. Unfortunately for Windows users, that's just not true.
Linux on the on the hand has a larger group of developers and testers working on a set of code, this makes it much more likely any flaws will be caught and fixed quickly. This, in other words, is essentially the polar opposite of the "security through obscurity" argument.Not only that, but Linux users can fix problems themselves. Microsoft may tout its large team of paid developers, but it's unlikely that team can compare with a global base of Linux user-developers around the globe
