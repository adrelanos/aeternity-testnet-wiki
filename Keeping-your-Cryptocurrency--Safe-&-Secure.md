Cryptocurrency has changed the way we use currency. It allows us to be
in a sense or own bankers and it provides us with new ways to buy and
sell products. However, it brings with it one of the inherent problems
that all other currencies have weather its paper money or digital
currency. Malicious users and thieves will go to just about
any lengths necessary in order to obtain your hard earned aeon,.                                                    They don't care about who you are, how nice a person you are
or how adversely affected you will be from them stealing your aeon.

It seams like everyday we hear of a story about someone either losing
their digital currency or having had it stolen by a
malicious user. In many of those cases had the victim
implemented a few simple security measures their digital currency would
not have been stolen. This does not mean that you can follow all the
security practices on the page and you will have nothing to worry about.
Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done to prevent a gifted
attacker that is committed to gaining entry into your
computer. The best you can do is use the security best practices below
in an effort to mitigate a majority of these threats.

## Security Best Practices

### Physical Security

The first thing that we will go over is physical security. This means
restricting physical access to your computer and hardware wallets. How
do we do this? It starts with following the dos and don'ts.

* If you are leaving your house it is a good to put your laptop and
  hardware wallet in a safe. Not all of use have a safe in our homes,
  however they are worth the money if we have something of value.
  Otherwise, if no safe is available hiding your hardware in a place
  that is hard to find is another option. Even if its in a linen closet
  or under a blanket in your bedroom. Remember a thief who steals your
  laptop may not even know that there is software wallet on your
  computer filled with aeon. The thief just sees a valuable laptop for
  the taking. The same thing goes for hardware wallets. The thief may
  not even know what a hardware wallet is, all he cares about is that it
  could have value.

* Never leave your laptop or hardware wallet in a public place. If you
  do take them into a library or classrooms, do not leave them alone,
  not even for a minute while you go to the restroom or out to your car.
  Thieves look for such opportunities. However, if you must leave your
  laptop unattended in a public place, lock it up with a Kensington
  lock.

* Never leave your laptop or hardware wallet unattended in your office
  or dorm room. Once again if you must step out for a moment, use a
  Kensington lock. Remember thieves will go after what is easiest for
  them to steal. If they have a choice between 2 identical laptops and 1
  of them is secured with a Kensington lock, which one do you thing they
  will go for? They will take the path of least resistance and steal the
  laptop that does not have a notebook lock.

* If you have to leave your laptop or hardware wallet in a car, put them
  in a bag and put the bag in the trunk. It is preferable that you stop
  somewhere before you reach your destination so potential thieves don't
  see you putting your hardware into the trunk. ##

### Choosing an Os

Choosing your operating system is arguably the single most important
decision that you will make when it comes to keeping your aeon safe and
secure. With so many operating systems to choose from how do we decide
which one best suits our needs? First we will have do decide what our
needs our. Since this paper focuses on keeping our digital currency
secure will require a open-source OS. Why do we need an open-source
operating system and not say, that wonderful OS named Window? Well, that
is one of the questions we are going to answer along with a few others
on our journey to find the right OS.

- **Open-source v.s. Proprietary**


Open-source, we all have heard those words before, but what do they mean? 
Simply stated open-source is a decentralized (just like aeternity) 
developmental model that encourages open collaboration between peers and 
making products such as source code and documentation freely available to 
the public. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where
programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within
the community. Code is released under the terms of a software license. 
Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and 
publish their version (fork) back to the community.



Now that you have a basic understanding of open-source lets move onto                                           proprietary (also referred to as closed-source) software. Relatively
speaking proprietary software is the opposite of open-source software.
Proprietary software is computer software for which the software's 
publisher or another person retains intellectual property rights--usually
copyright of the source code. What this means is the public can not
download, modify, or publish their version of the software with out the
express permission of the software's publisher.


In most cases the publisher will not let anyone see the source code out
of fear that trade secrets or the source code will be stolen. You may be
wondering what all this has to do with keeping our digital currency
safe. Well, we are about to get to that now that we know the difference
between open-source and proprietary software.

- **Proprietary operating systems**

Proprietary operating systems like Windows has many more users than Mac and Linux combined. Since
they have all of these user does it mean that is is more secure? Why else would so many people use
them?

The answer to the first question is NO!Windows has more users but those people are not using Windows because it
is a secure operating system.

 
To answer the second question. Most people
are using it because because it has all the bells and whistles and its
easy to use. What makes Windows OS insecure is that the source code is
closed-source.

Microsoft if very strict about who they let see the source code. When
they do show the source code its only to their clients ( like the
government) but only after signing a Non-Disclosure agreement. This way
if someone were to steal trade secrets or tell the public what they saw
there would be severe legal repercussions.

What this means is that no independent security audits can be performed
and published on Windows OS. There is no way for the public to know if
there are any major security holes in the OS. We just have to take
Microsoft at it word that there are no back doors (insert laughter) or
security vulnerabilities (laughing even harder).

- **Open-source Operating systems**

Open-source operating systems like Linux do not have nearly as many
user as Window but they are much more secure. The source code is freely
available for everyone to see. This means that independent security
audits can be performed to make sure there are no major vulnerabilities
present. This also means that there are many more eyes looking at the
source code and therefore reporting security issues to the developers
much quickly than if it was closed-source. Many times bugs are reported
and patched before the security vulnerability can be exploited.

If there is a backdoor to the OS it would be found and reported very
quickly. This is all because Linux is open-source. ### Now that we have
a good understanding of proprietary and open-source we can discuss other
reasons why an open-source Linux disro is more secure than a
closed-source Windows OS.

* **User Account Privileges** In Windows, users are generally given
  administrator priveleges by default which means they have access to
  everything on the system. If the virus is able to penetrate their
  system, they can quickly gain access to important parts of the system.
  On the other hand, in Linux, users are given lower level access
  rights, and, theoretically, the virus can only access the users local
  files and folders thus preventing malicous code from infecting the
  entire system.
***
* **Social Engineering** Closed source operating systems like Windows
  are more vulnerabilities to social engineering attacks. Most viruses
  are spread by convincing users to doing something they shouldn't, like
  opening up an email attachment that is carrying a virus or worm or
  clicking on a malicious link.

  What makes Linux less susceptible to these types of attacks is most Linux
  users don't have root access however, it's much harder to accomplish any
  real damage on a Linux system by getting them to do something foolish.
  Before any real damage could be done, a Linux user would have to read
  the email, save the attachment, give it executable permissions and then
  run the program. Not very likely, in other words.

***

* **Separateness of Environment** Linux works in many environments and
  distros such as Debian, Qubes,  Arch, and many others. With
  Various email clients, shells and packaging systems that makes the
  system extremely fragmented and difficult for any virus. So, whereas a
  virus can be targeted squarely at Windows users, since for the most
  part use the same technology, reaching more than a small faction of
  Linux users is much more difficult.

***

* **How many eyes see the code** As stated above Windows source code is
  closed-source and has a limited set of paid developers who try to find
  the problems in the code. Windows devs would have you believe this is
  a good thing. They want you to believe that its a good thing that only
  the paid devs can see the source code. The phrase they like to use is
  "security through obscurity", which is a very common term and I'm sure
  you have heard of it. The expression is intended to suggest that
  proprietary software is more secure by virtue of its closed nature. If
  hackers can't see the code, then it's harder for them to create
  exploits for it: or so the thinking goes. Unfortunately for Windows
  users, that's just not true. Linux on the on the hand has a larger
  group of developers and testers working on a set of code, this makes
  it much more likely any flaws will be caught and fixed quickly. This,
  in other words, is essentially the polar opposite of the "security
  through obscurity" argument. Not only that, but Linux users can fix
  problems themselves. Microsoft may tout its large team of paid
  developers, but it's unlikely that team can compare with a global base
  of Linux user-developers around the globe.
### Choosing Your Linux Distribution 
With so many Linux distros: also referred to as flavors of Linux, how do we decide which one to use. Many people will tell you they are all the same and it comes down to user preference. However, all though many may share the same Linux kernel there are some major differences in the distributions. Since we are focusing on keeping our digital currency safe and secure we want a distro that focuses on security and stability.

**Debian** is well known for its security and stability and sets itself apart by being the largest and most comprehensive Linux distribution ever created having well over 1,000 volunteers working on the project since 1993. Because of this many derivatives of Linux distros are based off of Debian, and it has become the grandfather of a large family of Linux distributions.

Advantages 
* Efficient and well integrated packaging for a more robust system
* Publicly available bug tracking system
* Stability - some users report running Debian 1+ year without a single reboot!
* Security - being 100% open, security issues are exposed and plugged quickly 
***
**Qubes** is a security-focused desktop operating system that aims to provide security through isolation. Virtualization is performed by the Xen hypervisor , and user environments can be based on Fedora, Debian, Whonix, and Windows, among other operating systems.

Advantages

* The Xen hypervisor and administrative domain (dom0) in Qubes OS actively discourages any activity other than running VMs.
* The network stack and WiFi drivers are running in a dedicated, unprivileged network VM (NetVM), which substantially reduces the attack surface.
* An additional firewall VM is used to house the Linux kernel-based firewall, providing extra protection against a compromised NetVM.
* By default, Qubes OS is firewalled and no incoming ports are open.
* No networking is present in the administrative domain (dom0). Even dom0 upgrades are done in a dedicated UpdateVM.
  (currently set by default to NetVM), before those are verified and installed in dom0.
* DisposableVMs are available to open untrusted applications, links, attachments and documents.
* Greater security of email-centric work environments is possible by using split GPG to protect private keys and      
  limiting network connections exclusively to the chosen email server.
* Protection against unintentional leaks of critical user data is possible by setting an empty NetVM field for the 
  corresponding qube.
*** 

**Tails** (which stands for ‘The Amnesiac Incognito Live System’) is probably the most well known privacy-focused distro however its features also make it a very secure OS . It can be run from a DVD in Live mode whereby it loads entirely into your system RAM and will leave no trace of its activity. The OS can also be used in ‘persistent’ mode where your settings can be stored on an encrypted USB stick. All connections are routed through the anonymity network Tor, which conceals your location. The applications in Tails have also been carefully selected to enhance your privacy and security.

Advantages

* Tails is amnesiac which means that when you reboot the OS any changes that were made to it in that session are    
  erased. So if a malicious user was to infect your computer with a virus or worm it would no longer be there after 
  you reboot the system. Keep in mind that if you are infected with a virus during that a session all the work you
  did during that session could be compromised. If you entered your password into your web wallet the malicious user 
  could very well have your password.
* The Tails devs have already tested and configured much of the software for you.  Most of the applications you
  will need come pre installed.

### BIOS Passwords
Let’s say you’ve followed good security practices and have a password set on your Linux user account. When your computer boots, someone will have to enter your Linux user account password to use it or access your files, right? Not necessarily.

The person could insert a removable device like a USB drive, CD, or DVD with a live operating system on it. They could boot from that device and access a live Linux desktop if your files are unencrypted, they could access your files. A  user account password doesn’t protect your files. 

You could change the boot order to force the computer to always boot from its internal hard drive, but someone could enter your BIOS and change your boot order to boot the removable device.

A BIOS  password provides some protection against this. Depending on how you configure the password, people will need the password to boot the computer or just to change BIOS settings.

Of course, if someone has physical access to your computer, all bets are off. They could crack it open and remove your hard drive or insert a different hard drive. They could use their physical access to reset the BIOS password. A BIOS password still does provide extra protection here, particularly in situations where people have access to a keyboard and USB ports, but the computer’s case is locked up and they can’t open it.

These passwords are set in your BIOS settings screen. You’ll need to reboot your computer and press the appropriate key during the boot-up process to bring up the BIOS settings screen. This key varies from computer to computer, but is often F2. If you need help, look at your computer’s documentation.

In the BIOS settings screen, locate the password option, configure your password settings however you like, and enter a password. You may be able to set different passwords for example, one password that allows the computer to boot and one that controls access to BIOS settings.

You’ll also want to visit the Boot Order section and ensure the boot order is locked down so people can’t boot from removable devices without your permission.

### Full Disk Encryption
Disk encryption **FDE** is a technology which protects the information on your drive, usb, or cd by converting it into unreadable code that cannot be deciphered easily by unauthorized people. Disk encryption used encryption software of hardware to encrypt all of the data that goes on a disk or disk volume Disk encryption prevents unauthorized access to the data stored on the disk.

What we will be focusing on is referred to as Full Disk Encryption. You would think--from the name--that full disk encryption signifies that everything on the disk is encrypted: however the master boot record (MBR) or the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) which is the code that starts the OS loading sequence, is not encrypted. There are drives with hardware based encyption that also encrypt the MBR or UEFI partitions. These are proprietary and therefore the source code can not be audited by independent security professionals.
