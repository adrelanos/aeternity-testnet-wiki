# Social startup to be launched on Aeternity : Shelpin

Brands will donate % percentages of their clients buyings, to the social project they want...

Social projects have defined milestones and funds will be released to them when decentralized oracles validate that milestones of the project are met. 

Fiat money from brands is escrowed and represented by Shelpin tokens that move from client wallet to social projects. 

There is a global enormous market dedicated to gain and maintain clients, last year and only in advertisement brands spent 582 BN USD.

Shelpin will grab the highest possible part of those funds building up a community of people that matters about Humanity and Earth , socially responsible brands and NGOÂ´s. 

This community has the power of making world a better place with people alike getting together when buying to socially responsible brands.

At a global scope the amounts of funds to be generated is so huge that "the greater good" should be very well defined... although nature of Shelpin philosophy is giving people the capacity of choosing where to contribute, and dedicate the funds from brands there, in a second phase of development we want to begin experimenting the effect of predictive markets in the decision of where part of the funding obtained from brands from clients goes, and what effect does it have in "the greater good" 

Is it better investing in health in Nigeria or in education in Birmania? this could be one of the questions that a PM fed by part of money from brands could help to solve. 

Shelpin project will be first based and tested on Ethereum and then migrated to Aeternity blockchain by Mid-2018.

Stay tuned!
