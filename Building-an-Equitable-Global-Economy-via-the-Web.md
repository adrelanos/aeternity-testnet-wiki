The Web connects three billion people today and will connect at least three billion more by the year 2020. 

It is ubiquitous and that ubiquity will only grow over the next decade. The Web is the best connector for information systems that exists today, but there is still much work that needs to be done when connecting the economic systems and value networks that span the world over.

It is our vision to connect the economic systems of the world via the Web, doing so will result in a global architecture for value exchange, built openly, secure by design, and accessible to all.

## Everybody is in

Imagine more than 2 billion people that in a sort of massive financial leapfrogging step , much further than M-pesa was, suddenly become part of “a world economy”, and we meant “a world economy” a p2p economy based on real value exchanged by peers.

It is not only about having an identity or a bank account, it about being included in a global equitable economy… mining, the creation of content, dapps, development,  fair trade, science contribution, in other words being directly injected to economy with the tools to develop themselves in that economy. 
 
æternity has a global and inclusive scope empowering free individual relationships of value exchange with the máximum security and trust ever imagined, its born design is thought to support every p2p transactions without tps limit.  

Can anything be more inclusive…?

It seems logical to think that if there is not a transaction per second limit, aeon price and cost drivers won´t be related to the availability of transactions like in other networks, so will be more accessible.

## The market reveals itself

Our relationships as humans are based on trust, and now blockchain technology offers us a new way of establishing it, shifting the traditional central entities of trust, from banks, to governments, to insurers or multinationals of all kinds.
 
This is not necessarily a typical anarchohippypyantisystem speech, it is the market itself that will displace the way of establishing trust understood as the provision of a service, just as it has disrupted other activities. 

Today´s technology is much more efficient, cheap, fast and reliable in the provision of trust-building services (for economic transactions, registration of properties, activities, and everything that requires confidence to function, that is, everything ... ) than the entities that traditionally provided us with these services. 

The market reveals itself and gives individuals the ability to manage trust amongst them backed by maths and criptography, isn´t it amazing? 

## We have a second attempt

We are building a new system of transacting and relating economically and civilly, backed by a technology of inmense power, This is a historic moment in which the basis of our social, political, and economic behavior and relations is being redefined, and we are gonna do better this time. 
 
And that “better” is related to each individual participating in the Equitative Global Economy.

 In old economy, trust is traded like any other good or service, and what is worst, it is traded at immense amounts of money. No more, all that money flows will progressively change directions and will recirculate. aeternity will boost that recirculation, building the new pipes of value for giving individuals the power to decide what is better in a truly decentralised economic, social and politic system. 

Humans have had the opportunity of managing trust amongst their species for thousands of years, now it is the turn of Maths. 

## From me to you

Remember that nice story about bartering in school, when we learnt that people exchanged potatoes for meat and so on... now forget it... and think about animals, living in communities... I grew vegetables and you had some cows, my vegs are yours and your cows are also mine, sounds different right?

It is all about intermediaries, think about it, we are surrounded by intermediaries, of several kinds and a true decentralisation comes in absence of those intermediaries, intermediaries are not fair because they always trade with trust and asymmetries, the new Internet allows an option to collaborate again as humans and "bartering" again. Remember that nice story, let us rewrite it and build æternal fræternity.
