## æternity Wiki - Draft Documents

Do not delete these files at moment, it could be that users do work
on them again at an other time. If you delete a page:

* Check if the doc [abc you and me](abcyouandme) is under menu point „Draft“
  at the sidebar, if not move it there.
* Visit this site add it to the above list, please.
* check back later
* if you delete a page now, do what I have done with abc you and me, use
  this ~sign~ for the title and
* set the link to draft-documents and add a date on the list

Note: This is also only a suggestion, you can do what you want, feel
free. But it could be useful to work on Wiki pages together
[Slack Channel](https://aeternity.slack.com/archives/C59BALQCE/p1495699809433243)
and share this information with the community and all others. From time
to time we will come back and check whats the best to do. Sorry for my grammar (I’m stupid german :))
