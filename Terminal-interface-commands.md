### Terminal interface commands


**What do we mean with Terminal interface commands?**

Let me explain: If you have installed the æternity software (get started here) then you got access to the
command line tools. We call them also CLI commands. For those commands and what you can do with them is this page for.

## What you must know before!

These commands are _internal commands_ this internal commands of æternity are handled by **many** internal modules.

The [api-examples page](Api-Examples) will only access to the commands inside this two files:
 - [internal_handler.erl](../../../aeternity/testnet/blob/master/src/networking/internal_handler.erl) and 
 - [handler.erl](../../../aeternity/testnet/blob/master/src/networking/handler.erl)
 - this modules you finde under the sources folder [Networking](../../../aeternity/testnet/blob/master/src/networking/)

***
**WARNING! The CLI commands will do what you can expect of them. For example: Delete my account, then they will delete your account and if you have not all you need to recover your æternity account every amount is lost forever!**
