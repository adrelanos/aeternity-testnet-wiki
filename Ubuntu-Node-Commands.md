## Commands

First, you must download and install Ã¦ternity. The Instructions for [Ubuntu](Troubleshooting#for-ubuntu) and for [Mac](Troubleshooting#for-mac)  
## 
### Start the blockchain
Start your node with the following script:
```
sh start.sh
```
## 

### Sync with the network
To sync with the network and download the blockchain:
```
easy:sync().
```
## 
### Mining
To start mining with all CPU cores:
```
mine:start().
```
To stop mining:
```
mine:stop().
```
To check if you are currently mining:
```
mine:is_on().
```
If it answers **Go**; then its mining
## 
### Spend
```
easy:spend(To, Amount).
```
_"To"_ is the recipient's account ID.
## 
### Last transactions
```
tx_pool:data().
```
## 
### Find out your account ID, public key, and address with these 3 commands
To find out account ID:
```
keys:id().
```
To find out your public key run:
```
keys:pubkey().
```
To find out your address:
```
keys:address().
```
If it returns something less than 1, that means you don't have an account yet.
## 
### To calculate a shared_secret with a partner, you need a copy of their public key
```
keys:shared_secret(Pubkey).
```
## 
### Check your balance
```
easy:balance().
```
## 
### To stop a node run
```
easy:off().
```
## 
### Securing your node

To secure your node so no one can sign the transactions, you can either turn of the node, or you can run this command:
```
keys:lock().
```
To check if your node is locked:
```
keys:status().
```
## 
### Signing

To unlock your node so that you can start signing transactions again, run this command:
```
keys:unlock("password").
```
To manually sign a transaction:
```
keys:sign(Transactions, AccountRoot).
```
To manually sign raw binary data:
```
keys:raw_sign(<<"binary date">>).
```
## 
### Passwords and Keys

The node keeps an encrypted copy of your private key. The decrypted copy is only stored in RAM.                        

You can generate a new private key this way: ( !! Warning !!  This deletes your old private key!!)
```
keys:new("password").
```
To load a private key into an existing node:
```
keys:load(Pubkey, Privkey, "password").
```

To change the address password:
```
keys:change_password("old_password", "new_password").
```
## 
### Using Channels
Making a channel with the server:
```
easy:new_channel(Balance, ReceivingLimit).
```
 _Balance_ is how much of your money you put into the channel. _ReceivingLimit_ is how much money the server puts into the channel.
  This is the maximum amount of money that can be sent to you until the channel runs out of space. _ReceivingLimit_ needs to be bigger than _Balance_ or the server will not let you make the channel. Fee is the transaction fee, so that this transaction will be included into a block soon.

Checking your balance in the channel:
```
easy:channel_balance().
```
Gambling with the server:
```
easy:dice(Amount).
```

When you want to close the channel and get your money out:
```
easy:close_channel().
```

After closing channel you need to sync with the network to see if your channel is closed.

If your channel partner disappears, or breaks, you can still get your money without his help.  Start with a solo-close transaction, then wait over 100 blocks, then do a channel timeout transaction.
```
 easy:solo_close_channel().
```
### 
```
 easy:channel_timeout().
```
