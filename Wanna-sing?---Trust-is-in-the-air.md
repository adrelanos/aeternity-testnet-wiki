# Feel like singing?? Just get "that" song and sing it with this lyric instead ;)Fell free to record yourself and share


Trust is in the air everywhere I look around 
                                                                             
Trust is in the air in every chain and every block

And I don't know if i was foolish  

Don't know if I'm being wise

But it's something that we must believe in

And it's there when I trust strange guys

Trust is in the air, and the algoryhtms mint 

Trust is in the air , in the Oracle machine

Humans had his opportunity

Now it is the turn of Maths

And it's something about evolution

Nothing will be ever the same
 
Trust is in the air
Trust is in the air

Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh

Trust is in the air, and not sitting in a bank

Trust is in the air, Aeternity has arrived

And I don't know if you are a good guy

Don't know if you act good

But Satoshi set a revolution

And we all humans will share P2P

Trust is in the air everywhere I look around

Trust is in the air in every chain and every block

And I don't know if i was foolish

Don't know if I'm being wise

But it's happening at this very moment

And will change the way humans behave

TRUST is in the air
TRUST is in the air

Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh
