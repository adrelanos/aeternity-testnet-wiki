# Functions Of Money

First things first: let us see what money is and then we will put this information in some crypto-context.
So money is:
1. **A medium of exchange**
Unlike ancient times, where bartering was in fashion, money serves as a medium of exchange. Essentially letting you convert something into something else - by buying and selling and receiving or spending money.
2. **A store of value**
Any asset that you can buy and/or save your money by investing in it - that is a store of value. It can be precious metals, stocks, real estate, jewelry, etc. Note that modern money (currency) are not a good store of value because if inflation. 
3. **A unit of account**
This function of money lets you compare the cost or value of different things in life - the price of this house vs. the price of the other one, for example. In most daily situations and economies, the medium of exchange is the same as the unit of account - i.e. one and the same currency. 

These three points characterize money. The interesting thing is that you can have an entity, able to execute all three functions, without it actually being money or an actual currency. That entity is cryptocurrency and Bitcoin in particular.

## What/who determines cryptocurrencies prices:

The prices of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are greatly influenced by demand and supply. When the demand increases, the price will tend to rise or vice versa. But unlike other markets, cryptocurrency markets have a higher level of volatility as the prices fluctuate frequently.

While demand and supply may seem as the only factors that determine the prices of cryptocurrencies, there are other factors which attribute to the price as well. Speculation is one of those factors. It is fueled by recent press releases, development updates, and reputational issues. More often than not, positive news and press releases tend to bring about a rise in prices and vice versa. 

Other factors include the introduction of digital assets in larger exchange markets with high trading volume, acceptance of digital currencies by more merchants.

Traditional assets like metals (gold, silver, etc) or stocks attribute their prices to their intrinsic value. For example, the historic price of gold has always been going up, because investors know this is a finite resource. Hence, gold has high value. Of course, there are many other factors that affect gold price, but hopefully, you get the idea.

On the other hand, especially a while back, many journalists, users and institutional investors argued that cryptocurrency, bitcoin, in particular, does not have any intrinsic value. That way of thinking was quite logical in the traditional way asset value is defined, for example, relation to a particular economy (the EU or USA). 

In the case of bitcoin, scarcity plays a huge role defining intrinsic value. There will be a limited amount of bitcoins produces, so the price is set to always be growing in the future. So far, Bitcoin resembles gold a lot, in terms of the finite amounts that will ever be available.

However, the big difference comes from the community. In a way, the intrinsic value of cryptocurrency is derived to a great deal from the people themselves. This is due to the fact that as Bitcoin grew in popularity, investors actually realized its **intrinsic value comes predominantly from the fact that BTC is a hedge against pretty much everything**, especially fiat currency. 

*PS: Digital assets are otherwise known as cryptocurrencies.*
