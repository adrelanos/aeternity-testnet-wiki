The scope of the document is to explain that there exist more than one
definition of cold storage in the context of cryptocurrencies and to
explain how to:

* create a wallet offline
* sign a message offline
* create a transaction offline
* securely executing the transactions online
* explain why an offline created cryptocoin address / wallet can
  be securely checked from in the wild

## Definition: Cold Storage

*Cold storage* in the context of cryptocurrencies means to reserve crypto
currency coins offline. This storage exist there to save your
data and offline records for ever. But there exist a subtle different between
that and deep cold storage. The different is that this data could exist on a
medium which was at one time connected on a network.

Examples of cold storage medium:
* a piece of paper
* an offline computer <sup>(never connect(ed) to a network)</sup>
* a cd/dvd/blue ray -disk <sup>(never connect(ed) to a network)</sup>

What cold storage does not mean in our case:

>If something, usually food, is kept in cold storage, it is put in
>artificially cold conditions, usually to stop it from decaying.

In the wild there exists a site where you can read the pros and cons: just
search for 'cold storage & cryptocoins'

## Definition: Deep cold storage

A *deep cold storage* in the context of cryptocurrencies mean to reserve
cryptocurrency coins offline AND the wallet used was created offline.
