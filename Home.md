<b>æternity Blockchain – A Functional Oracle Machine<p>

æternity is a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) protocol built from scratch in [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) with speed, efficiency and scalability in mind. It offers a unique hybrid [proof of work (PoW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) and [proof of stake (PoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) [consensus mechanism](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-blockchain-basics-intro-bluemix-trs/) that can be used to check [[oracles]]. This maximizes efficiency by not layering consensus mechanisms. [[State channels]] maximize scalability and privacy by removing the need to store smart-contract code on-chain. Transfer of [tokens](http://cruiserselite.co.in/downloads/btech/materials/second%20sem/4/e-com/UNIT-3.pdf) through channels is done by function-based [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) which have access to real-world data through the oracle. æternity thus renders smart contracts faster, easier to execute, and more fault-tolerant, without degrading their performance or functionality.<p>

1. The prevalent stateful designs render smart contracts for platforms like [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) rather hard to analyze. Moreover, combining statefulness with sequential ordering of transactions greatly reduces the scalability of the blockchain.
2. The difficulty of introducing real-world data into smart contract platforms in a trustless, decentralized, and reliable manner significantly impedes a large number of applications.
3. Most smart contract platforms have limited abilities to update themselves to cope with newly emerging economic and technological knowledge.<p>

Recent studies of state channel technology have proven that storing state on-chain is unnecessary. In most cases, all data can be stored in state channels, and the blockchain would be only used to settle the economic results of exchange of information and/or to act as a judge whenever a dispute occurs. This represents an alternative blockchain architecture approach, which is marked by [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) smart contracts that exist in state channels but not on the blockchain. This boosts scalability as all transactions are independent and can be processed in parallel. Furthermore, this approach means that smart contracts will not write to [shared state](http://wiki.c2.com/?SharedStateConcurrency), which will greatly simplify contracts’ safety and the process of testing and verification.<p>

æternity's ["Cuckoo Cycle" PoW algorithm](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/059.pdf) is more power efficient than that of current blockchains, and enables the development of better [random access memory (DRAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory) chips for mining. Since low-power devices such as smartphones, tablets and laptops can efficiently mine new tokens, incentives for mining are decentralized and geographically distributed, and shifted away from large mining entities that use [application-specific integrated circuit ("ASIC")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) chips designed specifically to take advantage of a particular PoW algorithm.<p> 

These applications will also benefit from several on-chain features, including:<p>
* Identities. Each account will be associated with a [unique ID number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). Users will be allowed to register distinctive names and link them to a data structure’s [Merkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) root.
* On-chain Governance. æternity's on-chain prediction markets projects the information available to the network to one single number between 0 and 1. This number is used to signal to the miners which version of the blockchain to mine on. This governance mechanism is also used to check the oracles for correctness. Further, certain blockchain variables (price of computation, blocksize, etc.) will also be determined by this mechanism.
* Insured Crowdfunding. [Insured crowdfunding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_crowdfunding#Crowdfunding_insurance) can be implemented via means of [dominant assurance contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assurance_contract#Dominant_assurance_contracts), which are smart contracts that are created to raise money for a good cause.
* Decentralized Education Marketplace. æternity's powerful features can be used to disrupt education by creating an open marketplace where students and teachers can trade private or group lessons. It could include social profiles of teachers and students, gamification, etc. Students could allow more than one teacher to rate a test, exam or work.
* Supply Chain Management. The supply chain management can be trusted to a smart contract that is constantly interfacing with the oracle on æternity. The demand for any product can be fed to the smart contract through the oracle. It will automatically trigger the contract to send procurement orders to suppliers or raw materials providers, taking into consideration the normal delays of each item in the procurement process.
* [Other possible applications](https://github.com/aeternity/wiki/wiki/Idea-Box#decentralized-education-marketplace-on-%C3%A6ternity) include cross-chain atomic swaps, event contracts (e.g. insurance, whistleblowing), and prediction markets. 

<b>Campaign<p>

The Phase 1 "Friends, Family, and Real Innovators" contribution campaign ran for three days, beginning on April 3rd, 2017. Contributors were able to purchase 1,100 aeon tokens (AE) for every ethereum token (ETH) spent in the first 24 hours and 1,000 AE for every ETH thereafter. The first thousand who contributed 12 ETH or more were also entitled to a limited edition æternity branded Ledger Nano S hardware wallet. 2466 contributors generated 139,099,689.485 AE through a total contribution of 121,265.614 ETH and 323.5482 [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). At fiat to cryptocurrency conversion rates of 5/28/17, the USD value translates to over $700k in BTC and close to $21,000,000 in ETH, totaling to nearly $22,000,000.

[Phase 2, the "Early Adopter" round](https://wallet.aeternity.com/) begins on May 29th and will be open for three full weeks - or until contributions reach the cap of twenty one million Swiss Francs (CHF). This round will allow contributors to purchase 800 AE for each ETH contributed over the first 24 hours, 750 over the remainder of the first week, 700 AE per ETH over the second week, and 650 AE per ETH over the third week. BTC will also be accepted.

To contribute to the campaign, you will need to use the æternity contribution wallet at [wallet.aeternity.com](https://wallet.aeternity.com/), fund that wallet and then proceed with your transfer.

Contributors will be able to use their æons after Phase 2 is complete. These tokens will be distributed right after Phase 2, directly to the contribution addresses (for ETH contributors) as [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) tokens on the [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) network). These will be taken care of automatically by a smart contract.

The contributor portion will comprise 82% of the initial æternity AE tokens. 17% of funds will be allocated to [Aeternity Anstalt](http://kundmachungen.li/AktuellsteNeugr%C3%BCndungen/Details?nr=FL00025283581&Firma=AETERNITY+ANSTALT&ort=Triesen&datum=11.11.2016), the foundation, and the founding team. The remaining 1% will be allocated to holders of BTC or ETH, accessible when the æternity Blockchain launches.

<b>Background on Blockains and æternity<p>

In 1990, Nick Szabo proposed the concept of "smart contract", which appeared almost simultaneously with the Internet. But due to the lack of a credible execution environment, smart-contracts were not developed and functional. After the development of Bitcoin, people realized that its underlying technology - Blockchain is able to provide a credible backbone and execution environment for smart contracts. 

The æternity team are putting forward their views on ​​Blockchain development, their approach is that it is inefficient to store application status and code on the chain. The æternity white-paper explains all the underlying reasons for that. æternity will have a highly scalable Blockchain architecture where State channels will be integrated to enhance the privacy and scalability. With this innovative solution, users can quickly and privately perform large volumes of transactions and perform complex processes off-chain, which provides a solid foundation for large-scale and enterprise applications æternity also has a consensus mechanism that can also be used to view the oracle. This will make the Oracle machine very efficient (cheap) because it will avoid the overlap of several consensus mechanisms. Using æternity, any real-world data can be retrieved by the Blockchain, which can generate value for smart contracts and open the door for real-world applications.
The tokens can be transmitted though channels trustlessly, and smart-contracts can access the answers of the Oracle. The fact that the contract code and status are not stored on the chain, will make it easier and faster to analyze and process the contracts.

æternity has already completed its first contribution round in early April, and successfully raised the then equivalent of $ 5 Millions in Bitcoins and Ethers (almost $ 22 Millions valuation now).
