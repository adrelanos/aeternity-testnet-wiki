æternity is a new type of blockchain that innovates and expands upon existing platforms such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Augur. æternity supports the interfacing of real-world data with smart contracts through decentralized Oracles. By eliminating the burden of contract executions that weigh down the network, æternity's scalability and trustless Turing complete state channels set it apart from Ethereum.
