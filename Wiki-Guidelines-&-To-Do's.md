## Editing the Wiki


    BEFORE ADDING CONTENT TO THE WIKI, PLEASE READ UP THOROUGHLY ON EXISTING CONTENT TO AVOID DUPLICATED CONTENT!
    please read the Wiki Guidelines & To Do's before contributing.

    æternity is spelled æternity not Æternity, even if it's the beginning of a sentence.

    Please do not change referenced content as it breaks the links

## Wiki Guidelines

The dedicated Wiki channel on Slack is
[HERE](https://aeternity.slack.com/messages/C59BALQCE/details/) feel
free to join us!

## Before **adding** content:

* Please read the wiki content regarding your topic thoroughly before
  adding any new content (duplicated content will not be counted as wiki
  bounty.)
* Ask in the
  [Slack Wiki Channel](https://aeternity.slack.com/messages/C59BALQCE/details/)
  if the content is somewhat meaningful.
* [read: About GitHub Wikis](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/)

[☝](#)
## After **adding** content:

* add the page to the [Navigation Sidebar](_Sidebar.md/) ------>
* if you like you can promote the content on your social media channels


[☝](#)
## Page translations

**If you translate a page into your language please use the following
taxonomy:**

**page title example:**
- [German]-Titel-der-original-Seite
- [Spanish]-Título-de-la-página-de-origen
- [Italian]-Titolo-della-pagina-di-origine

and so forth.

[☝](#)
## Handling of page titles

- **Do not change** the name of the page titles until 30th of May 2017.
  This sometimes breaks the commit history (if 'unsupported' characters
  are contained in the title) by creating a new page. Some contributors
  have lost their edits because of this; @zwilla and @DanMercurius
  accidentally did so, and both are really sorry for that!

[☝](#)
## Adding images

* Please open an
  [issue / ticket](https://github.com/aeternity/wiki/issues)
* Upload Your image, including a short reason & link to the page you
  want to use
* Image will be reviewed and approved in a timely manner (24h)

[☝](#)
## Markdown & Syntax:

* æternity is spelled æternity **not** Æternity, even if it's the
  beginning of a sentence.
* even in page titles æternity **not** aeternity should be used.
* you can jump right in and edit if you see a mistake or something that
  looks weird (these are valid contributions to the wiki bounty)
* make sure you use relative links wherever possible! eg. if you want to
  refer to the "[[Understanding æternity|Understanding-æternity]]" page,
  you can use `[[Understanding æternity|Understanding-æternity]]`
* Use hashes for headers (# = H1 / ## = H2 / ### = H3). *** = horizontal
  line.

**When editing anything, please always comment your changes in the edit
message.**

## <a> Wiki To Do's</a>

[Dan’s post](https://aeternity.slack.com/archives/C59BALQCE/p1495980563682848),

* [x] Specifications: we want a dedicated repo for the wiki under
      github.com/aeternity/website/wiki; in order to upload content to
      the repo to reference it in the wiki and at a later point on the
      website www.aeternity.com. The revision history needs to be
      completely migrated as well. [acetronaut 17-05-08]
* [x] Add [Google Calendar plugin](Idea-Box#google-calendar-plug-in)
      This is not possible in github - issue closed
* [x] Add [Subpages](Idea-Box#subpages) to Wiki This is not possible in
      github - issue closed
* [x] Revert [THIS PAGE](Understanding-Aeternity) back to the revision
      before content was deleted [davidiach 17-05-06]  
      **there has been a misunderstanding:**

[This page](https://github.com/aeternity/wiki/wiki/Understanding-%C3%A6ternity)
_contains revisions that are missing in the copied page, that got
migrated into the new Repo by accident._ _Since the migration already
happened, we need to somehow import the revision from the above page to
here:_

    _[Understanding æternity (in the new wiki repo)](https://github.com/aeternity/wiki/wiki/Understanding-%C3%A6ternity)_
