Anyone who wants to store or transfer value with unparalleled speed, reliability, and privacy can do so with æternity. Think Bitcoin and Ethereum upgraded. Below is a summary of the various user types and how they might start with æternity.

## Contributors

Contributors can support æternity directly by participating in the [second phase](https://wallet.aeternity.com/) of the contribution campaign or by purchasing AE on an exchange once aeon has been listed on them.

## Speculators

Although we don't endorse it, many people will want to speculate on the price of aeon. Speculators purchase assets hoping to make a short-term profit based on anticipating developments in fundamentals or the emergence of certain profitable trading patterns.
 
## Contract writers and developers

Thanks to its unique features (state channels, decentralized oracles, on-chain governance, ENS) in addition to everything else blockchains have to offer, æternity is a logical choice for developers and smart contract writers.

## Acquiring Tokens

The first round to purchase AE tokens was during æternity's public 'Friends, Family and Real Innovators' round which took place on 3rd April 2017, 13:05 GMT and lasted for 72 hours until 6th April 13:05 GMT. This round was open to the public, meaning anyone could participate. At this time, you were able to buy 1000 AE tokens for 1 ETH. Investors in the first 24 hours received an extra 10% for a total of 1100 AE tokens for 1 ETH and the first 1000 contributors above 12 ETH will receive 1 'limited edition' æternity branded Ledger. 

The second round will begin May 29th, 2017. You can participate and follow any updates here: https://wallet.aeternity.com/
