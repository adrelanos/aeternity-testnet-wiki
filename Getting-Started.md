Anyone who wants to store or transfer value with unparalleled speed, reliability, and privacy can do so with æternity. Think Bitcoin and Ethereum upgraded. Below is a summary of the various user types and how they might start with æternity.

Contributors can support æternity directly by participating in the [second phase](https://wallet.aeternity.com/) of the contribution campaign or by purchasing AE on an exchange once aeon has been listed on them.
