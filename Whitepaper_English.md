### Abstract
 Since the introduction of Ethereum in 2014, there has been great interest in decentralized, trust-less  applications
(smart contracts). Consequently, many have tried to implement applications with real world data on top of a blockchain. We believe that storing the application’s state and code on-chain is wrong for several reasons: It bloats the chain size, exposes smart contracts to unnecessary vulnerabilities, and reduces privacy, thus preventing the access of blockchains for private uses cases (banks, private companies, etc).

This is why æternity is being developed as the only blockchain that can – by its core design – sustain throughput of mainstream world use cases while providing real world interfaces within its blockchain. 


* It can handle larger transactions throughput (more than Visa and legacy systems) thanks to its integrated state channels.

* The state channels processing off-chain make smart contracts easier to analyze, faster to process, and more private while not sustaining any substantial loss in functionality.

* Its internal consensus mechanism can check the oracle and provide the blockchain with real world data, neglecting the need to implement inefficient oracle mechanisms on top of it (such as Augur or Gnosis on top of Ethereum). 

Applications like markets for synthetic assets and prediction markets can be efficiently implemented at global scale. Several parts have proof-of-concept implementations written in Erlang. Development tools and application essentials such as a wallet, naming, and identity system will soon be provided.
