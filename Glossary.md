# Blockchain 
A distributed, tamper-proof database with metered
access. The database is defined by a growing list of
hash-linked blocks and can have any rules for appending
them.

# Aeon 
An aeon represents a unit of account and an access
right to the Æternity blockchain. It is transferable.
Transaction A message from a user to the blockchain.
This is how users can use their currency to access the
blockchain.

# State Channel 
A relationship between two users recorded
on the blockchain. It enables users to send aeon back
and forth, and to create trustless smart contracts between
them that are enforced and settled by the blockchain.
Hash A hash takes as input a binary of any size. It gives
a fixed sized output. The same input always hashes to
the same output. Given an output, one cannot calculate
the input.

# Hashlocking 
This is how we connect pairs of channels to
make smart contracts that involve more than 2 people.
A secret is referenced by it’s hash. When the secret is
revealed, it can update multiple channels at the same
time.

# Governance 
A well-defined process of making decisions for
the future protocol(s) of the blockchain.

# Oracle 
A mechanism that tells the blockchain facts about
the world we live in. Using oracles users can predict the
outcome of events, external to the blockchain system.
Value-Holder A user who owns aeon, or a financial derivative
in the system.

# Validator 
A validator is a user who participates in the
consensus mechanism. In the case of Æternity, every
value-holder can participate.

# Address
Addresses (Cryptocurrency addresses) are used to receive and send transactions on the network. An address is a string of alphanumeric characters, but can also be represented as a scannable QR code.

# Agreement Ledger
An agreement ledger is distributed ledger used by two or more parties to negotiate and reach agreement. 

# Attestation Ledger
A distributed ledger providing a durable record of agreements, commitments or statements, providing evidence (attestation) that these agreements, commitments or statements were made. 

# ASIC
ASIC is an acronym for "Application Specific Integrated Circuit". ASICs are silicon chips specifically designed to do a single task. 

# Bitcoin (uppercase)
The well known cryptocurrency, based on the proof-of-work blockchain.


# Blockchain
A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks (rather like collating them on to a single sheet of paper). Each block is then ‘chained’ to the next block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows block chains to be used like a ledger, which can be shared and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions.

# Block Height
Block height refers to the number of blocks connected together in the block chain. For example, Height 0, would be the very first block, which is also called the Genesis Block.

# Block Reward
The reward given to a miner which has successfully hashed a transaction block. Block rewards can be a mixture of coins and transaction fees, depending on the policy used by the cryptocurrency in question, and whether all of the coins have already been successfully mined. 

# Central Ledger
A central ledger refers to a ledger maintained by a central agency. 

# Confirmation
A confirmation means that the blockchain transaction has been verified by the network. This happens through a process known as mining, in a proof-of-work system. Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.

# Consensus Process
The process a group of peers responsible for maintaining a distributed ledger use to reach consensus on the ledger’s contents. 

# Consensus Point
A point – either in time, or defined in terms of a set number or volume of records to be added to the ledger – where peers meet to agree the state of the ledger.

# Cryptocurrency
A form of digital currency based on mathematics, where encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies operate independently of a central bank.

# Digital Commodity
A digital commodity is a scarce, electronically transferrable, intangible, with a market value.

# Digital Identity
A digital identity is an online or networked identity adopted or claimed in cyberspace by an individual, organization, or electronic device.

# Distributed Ledger
Distributed ledgers are a type of database that are spread across multiple sites, countries or institutions. Records are stored one after the other in a continuous ledger. Distributed ledger data can be either "permissioned" or "unpermissioned" to control who can view it. 

# Difficulty
Difficulty, in Proof-of-Work mining, is how hard it is to verify blocks in a blockchain network. 

# Double Spend
Double spend refers to a scenario where someone tries to send a transaction to two different recipients at the same time. However, once a transaction is confirmed, it makes it nearly impossible to double spend it. The more confirmations that a particular transaction has, the harder it becomes to double spend.

# Genesis Block
The very first block in a block chain.

# Hashrate
The number of hashes that can be performed by a miner in a given period of time (usually a second).

# Ledger
An append-only record store, where records are immutable and may hold more general information than financial records. 

# Mining
The process by which transactions are verified and added to a blockchain. This process of solving cryptographic problems using computing hardware also triggers the release of cryptocurrencies. 

# Multi Signature
Multi-signature (multisig) addresses allow multiple parties to require more than one key to authorize a transaction. The needed number of signatures is agreed at the creation of the address. Multi signature addresses have a much greater resistance to theft.

# Off-Ledger Currency
A currency minted off-ledger and used on-ledger. An example of this would be using distributed ledgers to manage a national currency.

# On-Ledger Currency
A currency minted on-ledger and used on-ledger.

# P2P
Peer-to-peer (P2P) refers to the decentralized interactions that happen between at least two parties in a highly interconnected network. P2P participants deal directly with each other through a single mediation point.

# Participant
An actor who can access the ledger: read records or add records to. 

# Peer
An actor that shares responsibility for maintaining the identity and integrity of the ledger. 

# Permissioned Ledger
A permissioned ledger is a ledger where actors must have permission to access the ledger. Permissioned ledgers may have one or many owners. When a new record is added, the ledger’s integrity is checked by a limited consensus process. This is carried out by trusted actors — government departments or banks, for example — which makes maintaining a shared record much simpler that the consensus process used by unpermissioned ledgers. Permissioned block chains provide highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties. A permissioned ledger is usually faster than an unpermissioned ledger.

# Private Currency
A currency issued by a private individual or firm, typically secured against uninsured assets. 

# Private Key
A private key is a string of data that shows you have access to aeons in a specific wallet. Private keys can be thought of as a password; private keys must never be revealed to anyone but you, as they allow you to spend the aeons from your aeon wallet through a cryptographic signature.

# Proof-of-Stake
An alternative to the proof-of-work system, in which your existing stake in a cryptocurrency (the amount of that currency that you hold) is used to calculate the amount of that currency that you can mine.

# Proof-of-Work
A system that ties mining capability to computational power. Blocks must be hashed, which is in itself an easy computational process, but an additional variable is added to the hashing process to make it more difficult. When a block is successfully hashed, the hashing must have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered proof of work.


# Replicated Ledger
A ledger with one master (authoritative) copy of the data, and many slave (non-authoritative) copies.

# Scrypt
An alternative proof of work system to SHA-256, designed to be particularly friendly to CPU and GPU miners, while offering little advantage to ASIC miners.

SHA 256
The cryptographic function used as the basis for the work system.

# Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are contracts whose terms are recorded in a computer language instead of legal language. Smart contracts can be automatically executed by a computing system, such as a suitable distributed ledger system.

# Tokenless Ledger
A tokenless ledger refers to a distributed ledger that doesn’t require a native currency to operate.

# Transaction Block
A collection of transactions on the network, gathered into a block that can then be hashed and added to the blockchain.

# Transaction Fee
A small fee imposed on some transactions sent across the network. The transaction fee is awarded to the miner that successfully hashes the block containing the relevant transaction.
